# Solar_heater_nd_generator

## Still in progress, the thermal storage and water circulation system arent complete yet!

The main purpose of this project is to build an affordable proof of concept of a small sized solar generator using parabolic mirror and thermal storage instead of solar cells.
However I've built this project with the intention of teaching some concepts such as magnetic and planetary gearboxes, steam turbine, parabolic mirrors, heat transfers and so on.

Since a small generator like that isn't very efficient, the parabolic mirror with the water circulation system can be use to heat domestic wwater or directly water in radiators. This solution is almost as cheap as classic black solar heater but a lilte bit more complex but also more efficient.
